# PublicKeys Overview

The Public Keys endpoints enable low-level access to generate new private/public key pairs. At times, you may want to create these pairs yourself without using the [Asset Accounts](<../../use-cases/Asset Accounts/>) abstraction.  The endpoints documented below give you flexible management of key pairs without tying them to specific assets or Blockchains.&#x20;



Currently, Dfns supports the creation of key pairs predicated on either ECDSA or EDDSA cryptographic algorithms.
