# Introduction

This section is where you can find our complete API reference, including request operations and responses.

We offer access to **mainnets** and **testnets** through the following hosts/root endpoints (occasionally referred to as `customerApiDomain` in our legacy docs):

* `api.dfns.ninja` (testnet)
* `api.dfns.io` (mainnet)

⭑ **Note**: These environments are fully segregated — on two distinct TLDs. As such, entities and authorization can **NOT** be used cross-environment.
