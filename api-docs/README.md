# API reference

This is where you can find our complete API reference, including request operations and responses.

By far the most common action performed with Dfns is to [create an asset account](./assets/CreateAssetAccount.md). 

It is a core component of many of the most common customer scenarios, including [making a payment](../use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySimplePaymentScenario.md) and [signing payments](../use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySignatureScenario.md), and is also an easy way to get started with Dfns APIs.
