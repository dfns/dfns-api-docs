# Introduction

This section is where you can find our complete API reference, including request operations and responses.

We offer access to **mainnets** and **testnets** through the following hosts/root endpoints (occasionally referred to as `customerApiDomain` in our legacy docs):

* `api.dfns.ninja` (testnet)
* `api.dfns.io` (mainnet)

⭑ **Note**: These environments are fully segregated — on two distinct TLDs. As such, entities and authorization can **NOT** be used cross-environment.

By far the most common action performed with Dfns is to [create an asset account](assets/asset-accounts/createassetaccount.md).

It is a core component of many of the most common customer scenarios, including [making a payment](../use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySimplePaymentScenario.md) and [signing payments](../use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySignatureScenario.md), and is also an easy way to get started with Dfns APIs.
