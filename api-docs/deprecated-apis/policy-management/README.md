# Deprecated - Policy Engine v1

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please use our latest [Policy Engine](../../policy-engine/)
{% endhint %}

Policies enable businesses to enforce rules and controls on top of actions taken using the Dfns API.

Specifically, Policy Engine allows you to create `PolicyRules` and `PolicyControls`, and then use them together to create `Policies`.

For a broad overview including examples, see the [Policy Engine description](broken-reference) in the [Getting Started](../../../getting-started/onboarding-to-dfns.md) section.
