# Policy Control Executions

`PolicyControlExecution` records are created anytime a `Policy` is activated by one of its `PolicyRules`.  `PolicyControlExecutions` must be either approved or rejected prior to the `timeoutInMinutes` specified in the associated `PolicyControl`.  See [Policy Engine](broken-reference) for a complete description of the workflow.&#x20;
