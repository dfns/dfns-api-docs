# Employees Overview

`Employees` are your internal users of the Dfns platform who have access to the API and dashboard.  Currently, only Dfns Staff can create, update, or remove employees at your request.  We are in the process of adding APIs to enable employee management from the API and the dashboard now and expect this to be rolled out in Q1 2023.&#x20;
