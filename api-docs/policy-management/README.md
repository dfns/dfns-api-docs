 Policies enable businesses to enforce rules and controls on top of actions taken using the Dfns API.  

 Specifically, Policy Engine allows you to create `PolicyRules` and `PolicyControls`, and then use them together to create `Policies`.
 
 For a broad overview including examples, see the [Policy Engine description](../../getting-started/PolicyEngineIntro.md) in the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/GettingStarted.md) section.
