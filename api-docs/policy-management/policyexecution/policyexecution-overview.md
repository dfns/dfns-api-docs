# PolicyExecution Overview

`PolicyExecution` records are created anytime a `Policy` is triggered by a `PolicyRule`.  `PolicyExecutions` must be either approved or rejected prior to the `timeoutInMinutes` specified in the associated `PolicyControl`.  See [Policy Engine](../../../getting-started/PolicyEngineIntro.md) for a complete description of the workflow.&#x20;
