This property should not be set to true, unless outcomes are understood. For example: Let's say we have 3 policies: 

1. policy to require approval for payments over â‚¬5000
1. policy to require approval for payments done out of office hours
1. policy to require approval for payments done out of Geofence. 

In this case policies will require 3 approvals combined, which might not be an intent, and only one approval is required.
