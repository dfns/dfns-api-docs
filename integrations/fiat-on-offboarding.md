Mt Pelerin offers flexibility in how their widget is integrated [on the web](https://developers.mtpelerin.com/integration-guides/web-integration) and [on mobile](https://developers.mtpelerin.com/integration-guides/mobile-integration).  In all cases, developers can pass a blockchain address as the default recipient account for onboarding from fiat to crypto.  See the `addr` parameter description under [their options page](https://developers.mtpelerin.com/integration-guides/options).  Dfns customers can populate this parameter using either [addresses for asset accounts](../api-docs/high-level-api-asset-accounts-and-payments/asset-accounts/getassetaccountbyid.md) or [addresses derived from public keys](../api-docs/low-level-api-keys-and-transactions/public-keys-1/getaddressfornetwork.md).&#x20;



In order to offboard from crypto to fiat, Mt Pelerin provides end users with an address to transfer funds to in order to facilitate the conversion process.  Customers can easily facilitate payments to these addresses using the Dfns [payment APIs](../api-docs/high-level-api-asset-accounts-and-payments/payments/initiatepayment.md).&#x20;
