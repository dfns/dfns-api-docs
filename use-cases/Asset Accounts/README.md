# Asset Accounts

Whether you are creating a wallet application, managing customer assets, or deploying capital as a hedge fund, you need to be able to create and manage your assets. This is why we created Asset Accounts.

Asset Accounts are an abstraction over a public/private key pair or "wallet" that are designated to control one specific type of asset on a specific blockchain (eg. BTC on Bitcoin or ETH on Ethereum).   Asset Accounts simplify asset management and ensure the highest level of security by deploying different assets with different private keys, all managed via the Dfns MPC/TSS infrastructure.&#x20;

With asset accounts, you can:

* [Create an Asset Account](CreateAssetAccount.md)
* [Get account by ID](GetAccountById.md)
* [Get the balance of an account](GetBalance.md)
