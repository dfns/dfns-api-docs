# Asset Accounts

Whether you are creating a wallet application, managing customer assets, or deploying capital as a hedge fund, you need to be able to create and manage your assets. This is what Asset Accounts are for.

Asset accounts are an abstraction over a public/private key pair wallet that are designated to control one specific type of asset on a specific blockchain.   Asset Accounts simplify asset management and ensure the highest level of security by deploying different assets with different private keys, all managed via the Dfns MPC/TSS infrastructure.&#x20;

With asset accounts, you can:

* [Create an asset account](CreateAssetAccount.md)
* [Get account by ID](GetAccountById.md)
* [Get the balance of an account](GetBalance.md)
