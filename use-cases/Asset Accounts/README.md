# Asset Accounts

Whether you are creating a wallet application or managing customer assets as an investor or a hedge fund,
you need to be able to create and manage your or your customer's assets. This is what our Asset Account product is for.

Asset accounts are a core concept of DFNS where you can safekeep assets of any kind. You can think of it as a wallet, but we call them asset accounts. The reason for this is because "wallet" is an overloaded industry term used to describe too many different types of things.

With asset accounts, you can accomplish the following tasks:

- [Create an asset account](./CreateAssetAccount.md)
- [Get account by ID](./GetAccountById.md)
