# Payments

Payments are an abstraction over blockchain value transfer transactions.  Payments allow applications to initiate transfers of specific assets between different addresses.  By monitoring the input values of payments, Dfns ensures that all associated `Policies` are executed and logged.

Payments functionality includes the following:

* [Initiating a payment](InitiatePayment.md)
* [Getting a payment by its ID](GetPaymentById.md)
