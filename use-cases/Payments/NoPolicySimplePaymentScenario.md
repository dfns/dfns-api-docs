# Fun with Payments!

Let's dig into payments together.  Start by making an `Asset Account` without `Policies` and try transferring money between it and other accounts in various ways.  Verify the outcome of the action at each step.

* Start by [creating an Asset Account](<../Asset Accounts/CreateAssetAccount.md>) on a testnet&#x20;
* [Get the account using the ID](<../Asset Accounts/GetAccountById.md>)
* Try [transferring money](InitiatePayment.md) despite having a zero account balance
* Transfer funds from a public faucet to your asset account&#x20;
* Verify the funds transferred successfully by [getting your account balance](<../Asset Accounts/GetBalance.md>)
* [Transfer money](InitiatePayment.md) back to the faucet or to another address
* [Get information on your payment](GetPaymentById.md)&#x20;
* Try again, but this time pass an invalid ID to see what happens!
