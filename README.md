# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

 Welcome to the Dfns APIs! Dfns provides wallet-as-a-service infrastructure that enables crypto developers to forget about private key management so they can focus on building what matters most â€” their applications. Weâ€™ve hired teams of security and cryptography PhDs to build the industryâ€™s leading _Secure Multi-Party Computation_-based _Threshold Signature Scheme_ ([MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure\_multi-party\_computation)/[TSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold\_cryptosystem)) implementation so that you donâ€™t have to.

 If youâ€™re just getting started with Dfns APIs, head to our [**Getting Started**](getting-started/GettingStarted.md) section to learn about our nomenclature and API conventions.

 If you need details on a specific API endpoint, peruse our [API Docs](api-docs/) reference section for details on headers, query parameters, body parameters, response types, etc.

 Donâ€™t hesitate to [contact us](mailto:docs@dfns.co) if you have any questions about the APIs.  Our documentation is a humble work in progress and your constructive feedback is always appreciated.  So please don't hesitate to shoot us an email.

 Thanks!

 Dfns Docs Team
