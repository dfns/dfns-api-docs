# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Dfns APIs! Dfns provides custody-as-a-service that enables crypto developers of all kinds to get rid of private key management so they can focus on building what matters most â€” their applications. Weâ€™ve hired teams of cryptography PhDs to build the industryâ€™s leading _Secure Multi-Party Computation_-based _Threshold Signature Scheme_ ([MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure\_multi-party\_computation)/[TSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold\_cryptosystem)) implementation so that you donâ€™t have to.

If youâ€™re just getting started with Dfns APIs, head to our **GETTING STARTED** section to learn about our nomenclature and API conventions.

If you need details on a specific API endpoint, peruse our **API DOCS** reference section for details on headers, query parameters, body parameters, response types, errors, etc.

Donâ€™t hesitate to [contact us](mailto:docs@dfns.co) if you have any questions about the APIs. Also, this documentation portal is always a humble work in progress, and your constructive feedback is always appreciated. Shoot us an email, we'll be glad to read it.

Thanks!
