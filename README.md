# Welcome

Welcome to the Dfns APIs!  Dfns provides custody-as-a-service that enables crypto developers of all kinds to delegate private key management so they can focus on building what matters most - their applications.  We’ve hired teams of cryptography PhDs to build the industry’s leading MPC/TSS implementation so you don’t have to.

If you’re just getting started with Dfns, read our [Getting Started](getting-started/GettingStarted.md) guide to learn about our nomenclature and API conventions. If you need details on a specific API signature, go straight to our API Docs reference section for details on headers, query parameters, body parameters, response types, etc.

If you have any questions about the APIs or find any issues with our documentation, don’t hesitate to contact us: [docs@dfns.co](mailto:docs@dfns.co). Thanks!
