# Dfns SDKs

Dfns is in the process of building a number of SDKs across various language bindings to simplify your development experience. These SDKs wrap our API calls and configure the headers necessary for executing [request signing](../advanced-topics/authentication/request-signing.md) against our authentication service.

Of course, you can always develop directly against the API, but we've found in talking to developers that using an SDK accelerates their development process by obfuscating some of the more nuanced elements - eg. setting [the X-DFNS-USERACTION header](request-headers.md).&#x20;

## Typescript SDK

The Dfns [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts)  offers utilities to help Typescript developers get Dfns up and running more quickly.  It automatically populates all the [required headers](request-headers.md) and implements the cryptography for request signing.   This is a full SDK implementation which includes strongly typed function definitions which should enable IntelliSense in an IDE like Visual Studio Code:

* See the SDK [repository](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts) for a high level overview with detailed examples.&#x20;
* Additionally see these autogenerated[ SDK docs](https://dfns.github.io/dfns-sdk-ts/) detailing classes, methods, and types available.

## GoLang SDK

We've wrapped the native HTTP libs in Go to handle our request signing.  You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-go). &#x20;

## React Native SDK

We've built specific bindings for React Native into the Typescript SDK to help accelerate hybrid mobile development projects predicated on this popular framework.  Please see [the React Native section here](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts/tree/m/packages/sdk-react-native) for more details.&#x20;

## iOS Swift & Android Kotlin SDKs

For native platform developers, we've created an [iOS Swift SDK](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-swift) and an [Android Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-kotlin) to accelerate the iOS development process. &#x20;

## Flutter/Dart SDK

For developers using this hybrid mobile framework from Google, we have a Dart compatible SDK available [here](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-flutter).&#x20;
