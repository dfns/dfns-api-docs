# Typescript SDK

Dfns offers a [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts) to help simplify the developer experience.  This SDK wraps our API, and offers utilities to help out Typescript developers get started more quickly.  It automatically populates all the [required headers](../advanced-topics/authentication/request-headers.md) and implements the cryptography for request signing.&#x20;

You can check out:

* The SDK [repository](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts) which holds some docs and high level overview of it, with detailed examples.&#x20;
* More [precise SDK docs](https://dfns.github.io/dfns-sdk-ts/) detailing each class, methods and types available in it.
