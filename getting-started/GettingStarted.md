# Getting Started

Our documentation is currently composed of the following:

* An API docs reference
* Procedural how-tos and tutorials to address common workflows and use cases.

The easiest way to get started with Dfns APIs is to [create an Asset Account](<../use-cases/Asset Accounts/CreateAssetAccount.md>).  It is by far the most common action performed with Dfns APIs, as it is a core component of many common customer scenarios, including [making a payment](../use-cases/Payments/) and [signing transactions](../api-docs/public-keys/CreateSignature.md).



However before diving into the API, we recommend taking a moment to [read about some basic concepts of our data model](DataModelConcepts.md).&#x20;
