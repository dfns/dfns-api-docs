# Getting Started with Dfns

Our documentation is currently composed of the following:

* An API docs reference 
* Procedural how-tos and tutorials to address common workflows and use cases.

By far the most common action performed with Dfns is to [create an asset account](/solution-architecture/data/gitbook/api-docs/assets/CreateAssetAccount.md). It is a core component of many of the most common customer scenarios, including [making a payment](/solution-architecture/data/gitbook/use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySimplePaymentScenario.md) and [signing payments](/solution-architecture/data/gitbook/use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySignatureScenario.md), and is also an easy way to get started with Dfns APIs. 

<!--- You can explore the API reference documentation, or dive into one of our procedural guides to help you perform a task or address a use case. --->
