# Getting Started

Our documentation is currently composed of the following sections and pages:

* This **GETTING STARTED** section, including:
  * Overviews of Dfns's [policy engine](PolicyEngineIntro.md) and [data model concepts](DataModelConcepts.md)
  * An [API Authentication](authentication-authorization.md) page
  * An overview of the different [levels of abstraction of our APIs](DfnsAPIAbstractionLevels.md)
  * Some [intro videos](Videos.md) for the visual learners
* Procedural how-tos and tutorials to address common [use cases](broken-reference)
* The [**API DOCS**](../api-docs/) reference section of all currently supported endpoints and their operations

The easiest way to get started with Dfns APIs is to [create an Asset Account](<../use-cases/Asset Accounts/CreateAssetAccount.md>). It is the most common action performed with Dfns APIs, as it is a core component of many common customer scenarios such as [making a payment](../use-cases/Payments/InitiatePayment.md).
