# Getting Started

Our documentation is currently composed of the following:

* An API docs reference
* Procedural how-tos and tutorials to address common workflows and use cases.

The easiest way to get started with Dfns APIs is to [create an asset account](../api-docs/assets/CreateAssetAccount.md). It is by far the most common action performed with Dfns APIs, as it is a core component of many common customer scenarios, including [making a payment](../solution-architecture/data/gitbook/use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySimplePaymentScenario.md) and [signing payments](../solution-architecture/data/gitbook/use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySignatureScenario.md).
