# Getting Started

Our documentation is currently composed of the following sections and pages:

* This **GETTING STARTED** section, including:
  * Overviews of Dfns's [policy engine](PolicyEngineIntro.md) and [data model concepts](DataModelConcepts.md)
  * An [authentication/authorization](authentication-authorization.md) page
  * An overview of the different [levels of abstraction of our APIs](DfnsAPIAbstractionLevels.md)
  * Some [intro videos](Videos.md) for the visual learners
* Procedural how-tos and tutorials to address common [workflows and use cases](../use-cases/)
* The **API DOCS** reference section of all currently supported endpoints and their operations

The easiest way to get started with Dfns APIs is to [create an Asset Account](<../use-cases/Asset Accounts/CreateAssetAccount.md>). It is by far the most common action performed with Dfns APIs, as it is a core component of many common customer scenarios, including [making a payment](../use-cases/Payments/InitiatePayment.md) and [signing transactions](../api-docs/low-level-api-keys-and-transactions/transaction-execution/createsignature.md).

â­‘ **Note**: Before diving into the API, we recommend taking a moment to familiarize yourself with [some basic concepts of our data model](DataModelConcepts.md) to make the API requests and responses easier to understand.
