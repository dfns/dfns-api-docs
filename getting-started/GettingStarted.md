Our documentation is currently composed of the following sections and pages:

* This **GETTING STARTED** section, including:
  * Overviews of Dfns's [policy engine](PolicyEngineIntro.md) and [data model concepts](DataModelConcepts.md)
  * An [authentication/authorization](authentication-authorization.md) page
  * An overview of the different [levels of abstraction of our APIs](DfnsAPIAbstractionLevels.md)
  * Some [intro videos](Videos.md) for the visual learners
* Procedural how-tos and tutorials to address common [workflows and use cases](../use-cases/README.md)
* The  **API DOCS** reference section of all currently supported endpoints and their operations


The easiest way to get started with Dfns APIs is to [create an Asset Account](<../use-cases/Asset Accounts/CreateAssetAccount.md>).  It is by far the most common action performed with Dfns APIs, as it is a core component of many common customer scenarios, including [making a payment](../use-cases/Payments/InitiatePayment.md) and [signing transactions](../use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySignatureScenario.md).

We offer access to **mainnets** and **testnets** through the following hosts/root endpoints (occasionally referred to as `customerApiDomain` in our legacy docs):
* `api.dfns.ninja` (testnet)
* `api.dfns.io` (mainnet)

⭑ **Note**: These environments are fully segregated — on two distinct TLDs. As such, entities and authorization can **NOT** be used cross-environment.

⭑ **Note**: Before diving into the API, we recommend taking a moment to familiarize yourself with [some basic concepts of our data model](DataModelConcepts.md) to make the API requests and responses easier to understand.


<!--- You can explore the API reference documentation, or dive into one of our procedural guides to help you perform a task or address a use case. --->
