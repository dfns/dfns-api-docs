# Introduction

Our documentation is currently composed of the following sections:

* This Getting Started section, including overviews of Dfns's [policy engine](PolicyEngineIntro.md) and [data model concepts](DataModelConcepts.md), as well as [authentication/authorization](authentication-authorization.md).
* Procedural how-tos and tutorials to address common [use cases and workflows](../use-cases/README.md)
* An [API reference](../api-docs/README.md) of all endpoints and their operations
  

The easiest way to get started with Dfns APIs is to [create an Asset Account](<../use-cases/Asset Accounts/CreateAssetAccount.md>).  It is by far the most common action performed with Dfns APIs, as it is a core component of many common customer scenarios, including [making a payment](../use-cases/Payments/InitiatePayment.md) and [signing transactions](../use-cases/Payments/NoPolicySignatureScenario.md).

However before diving into the API, we recommend taking a moment to [read about some basic concepts of our data model](DataModelConcepts.md).

And for the visual learners, we've put together a few videos outlining the basics on our [Videos page](Videos.md).

<!--- You can explore the API reference documentation, or dive into one of our procedural guides to help you perform a task or address a use case. --->
