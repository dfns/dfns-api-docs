# Getting Started

Our documentation is currently composed of the following sections and pages:

* This **GETTING STARTED** section, including:
  * Overviews of Dfns's [policy engine](PolicyEngineIntro.md) and [data model concepts](DataModelConcepts.md)
  * An [API Authentication](authentication-authorization.md) page
  * An overview of the different [levels of abstraction of our APIs](DfnsAPIAbstractionLevels.md)
  * Some [intro videos](Videos.md) for the visual learners
* The [**API DOCS**](../api-docs/) reference section of all currently supported endpoints and their operations

The easiest way to get started with Dfns APIs is to [create an Asset Account](../api-docs/high-level-api-asset-accounts-and-payments/asset-accounts/createassetaccount.md). It is the most common action performed with Dfns APIs, as it is a core component of many common customer scenarios such as [making a payment](../api-docs/high-level-api-asset-accounts-and-payments/payments/initiatepayment.md).
